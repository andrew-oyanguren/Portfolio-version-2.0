### General Info

This project has me excited! This is my best work to date. I spent a lot of time on the details. From transition timings, effects, responsive layout, and user experience to the content I provided the user reader, I am very roud of my new portfolio.

I used Sass and took advantage of all of CSS like grid, flexbox, Psuedo classes, animations, as well as Sass's mixins, and variables. I am still going back over my code and organizing it. 

I used Javascript to manipulate the DOM and Events to enhance the User Experience. I am really excited to get back to my JS projects after this project!
